/**
 *  IMPORTANT!! YOU MUST USE THE FOLLOWING LINES OF CODE FOR PROMPTS AND OUTPUTS:
 *  To output size of tree: cout << "Size of tree: " << size << "\n";
 *  To output height of tree: cout << "Height of tree: " << height << "\n";
 *  To prompt the user to enter a name: cout << "Enter actor/actress name: " << "\n";
 *  To tell the user that actor/actress name was found: cout << name << " found!" << "\n";
 *  To tell the user that actor/actress name was NOT found: cout << name << " NOT found" << "\n";
 *  To prompt the user to try again: cout << "Search again? (y/n)" << "\n";
 *
 *  Use cin to process user input.
 *
 *  You MUST output size, then height, then prompt the user to search, as above.
 *
 *  You MUST have the prompt for entering the name appear if and only if 
 *  the user input for trying again is "y" followed by the return key
 *  You MUST have the program exit (exiting the prompt loop) if and only if
 *  the user input for trying again is "n" followed by the return key
 *  You should handle other inputs for the retry prompt, 
 *  but we will not be testing them.
 *
 *  Note that size, height, and name are local variables in main that you 
 *  should update accordingly. Also note that actor/actress names will be 
 *  in all caps, last name followed by first name 
 *  (except in odd cases, eg. "50 CENT" and "ICE-T")
